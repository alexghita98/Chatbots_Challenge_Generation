This program is a 'crackme'. It asks for a license key and, if correct, will unlock a hidden feature (the flag!). The key generation algorithm is complex and involves multiple steps, including arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and possibly some anti-tampering checks. Your task is to analyze the binary thoroughly, understand the license key validation logic, and generate a valid key to get the flag.
