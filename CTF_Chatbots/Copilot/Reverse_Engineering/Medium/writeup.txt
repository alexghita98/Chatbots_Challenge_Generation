Load the binary in Ghidra or IDA Free.

Identify the XOR key and the obfuscated target array.

Reverse the XOR operation to recover the correct input.

Extract and decrypt the flag using the same XOR key.

(Again, the challenge is not trully usable, as the precomputed values by Copilot do not lead to something human-readable)
