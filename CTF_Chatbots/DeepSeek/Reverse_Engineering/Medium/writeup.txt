Step 1: Initial Analysis
bash
file crackme_medium        # Check file type
strings crackme_medium    # Look for interesting strings
(this also yields the FLAG :D)


Step 2: Dynamic Analysis with GDB
bash
gdb ./crackme_medium
(gdb) disassemble transform
(gdb) disassemble main

Step 3: Identify Key Components
Password Transformation:

Each character is XORed with 0x55

The transformed input should equal "l3t_m3_1n"

Reverse the Transformation:

python
target = "l3t_m3_1n"
password = ''.join([chr(ord(c) ^ 0x55) for c in target])
print(password)  # Output: 'P4SSW0RD'

Step 4: Solve the Challenge
bash
./crackme_medium "P4SSW0RD"
